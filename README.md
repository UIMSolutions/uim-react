**React** is a **JavaScript library** specifically designed for building **user interfaces**. Unlike a full-fledged framework, React focuses on UI components and can be used in various environments, not just the web. 

1. **What Is React?**
   - React is **not a framework**, but rather a **library**.
   - It's used alongside other libraries to render UIs in specific environments.
   - For example, **React Native** allows building mobile applications using React.
   - On the web, React works in conjunction with **ReactDOM**.

2. **Components and UI Building:**
   - React's primary goal is to **minimize bugs** during UI development.
   - It achieves this through **components**, which are self-contained pieces of code describing parts of the UI.
   - Components can be combined to create a complete UI.
   - React abstracts much of the rendering work, allowing developers to focus on design.

3. **Use Cases:**
   - React doesn't enforce strict rules on code conventions or file organization.
   - Teams can adopt React as they see fit.
   - It can handle anything from a single button to an entire app's UI.
   - While React can be used for small UI elements, it truly shines when building entire apps.

4. **Tooling and Learning Curve:**
   - React has a **compilation process** (e.g., using Babel) for features like JSX (HTML-in-JavaScript).
   - Some consider React's tooling requirements heavy, but it's learnable.
   - In this article, we'll focus on using React to render a complete UI with the support of **Vite**, a modern front-end build tool¬π.
